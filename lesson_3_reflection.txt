- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I want to share with someone my code, when 2 people or more want to make changes on the same code and when I want to have a backup of my files.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because some changes may affect my changes and maybe that are changes that I don’t won’t.
