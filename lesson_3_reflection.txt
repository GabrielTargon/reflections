- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I want to share with someone my code, when 2 people or more want to make changes on the same code and when I want to have a backup of my files.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because some changes may affect my changes and maybe that are changes that I don’t won’t.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Forks: Copy a repository from another to your GitHub account remote, not local
    Clone: Cloning a repository on my local or/and remote account
    Branches: Changes made on my local repository

    When I want to copy another repository to my account I use Fork, because I can use and make changes that I want. When use clone when I want to clone my repository to my local and remote.

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    Because you can have access of the changes that were made, see the changes and merge with your local, even offline.
